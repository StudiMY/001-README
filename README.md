READ THIS IF YOU'RE NEW: Overall description of StudiMY curriculum and project structure.

# What
StudiMY is an initiative by MARIMORE ENGINEERING SDN. BHD. (925539-H) with
help from [Xoxzo Inc](https://info.xoxzo.com/en/) to create
and maintain a study curriculum and materials for the teaching of programming in a classrom
environment, guided by a mentor. These curriculum and materials are licensed under the
Creative Commons and is available for anyone to use.

## Teaching concepts
StudiMY puts emphasis on classroom experience and understanding when
writing its curriculum. We do not try to cram every topic to mark as many
checkboxes as possible.

The overall vision it to produce a higher level of understanding from practical
knowledge by doing actual exercises while walking through a particular curriculum,
with the mentor pointing in the right direction and students helping among themselves.

We believe this will allow students to not just be programmers, but engineers
and makers in the long run by cultivating the ability to identify reusable
concepts and self-study through trial-and-error.

# Project structure
Each repository in the project represents one classroom curriculum. Each
classroom curriculum can be considered a 5-hour learning experience, led by at
least one mentor.

This repository will contain the overall idea on what StudiMY is and how you
can use the materials in the project.

## Repositories
Each repository will contain the classroom text to be used for that particular
curriculum. These texts can be used on its own if desired, but it is designed in
a way to be taught alongside a mentor in a classroom environment.
