Welcome to 101 Readme's Mindmap!
================================

A lot of Python beginners are unable to see where they are going when they learn the language in a topical manner. 

So we came up with a mindmap, hopefully this will help us to see the bigger picture. We have categorise the topics into roughly 6 categories:-

* Syntax and Semantics
* Data Structure
* Algorithm
* Programming Paradigms
* Environment and Packaging
* Larger Programs

The idea is to list down the major pillars that will help us to be a better problem solver / software engineer and its respective topics that will help us to master them.
Although your learning is topical, knowing how to apply your knowledge is always better than just knowing the theory.

.. topic:: Remember !

    It does not matter how much you know, it's all about knowing how to apply what you know - problem solving.
