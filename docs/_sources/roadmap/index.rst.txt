The Roadmap
==============

Moving forward
===============
A lot of Python beginners are unable to see where they are going when they learn the language in a topical manner. 

So we came up with a mindmap, hopefully this will help us to see the bigger picture.
We have categorise the topics into roughly 6 categories:-

* Syntax and Semantics
* Data Structure
* Algorithm
* Programming Paradigms
* Environment and Packaging
* Larger Programs

The idea is to list down the major pillars that will help us to be a better problem solver / software engineer and its respective topics that will help us to master them.
Although your learning is topical, knowing how to apply your knowledge is always better than just knowing the theory.

.. topic:: Remember !

    It does not matter how much you know, it's all about knowing how to apply what you know - problem solving.

Curriculums
===========

We have structured our curriculums based on the mindmap, covering topics we think it's appropriate for a specific level.

How To Contribute to Mindmap
----------------------------
1. Update the `this text file <https://github.com/StudiMY/001-README/blob/master/Problem_Solving_with_Python.txt>`_.
2. Core team will `upload import the text file into coggle <https://coggle.help/article/34-import-files-into-coggle>`_.
