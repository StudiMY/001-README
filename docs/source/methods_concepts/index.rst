How
=================
There are many options to study programming using Python. Some of us learn it by
doing it ourselves through tips and tutorials we find on the internet. Some of
us learn it via books on our own pace, while others join paid classes online and
work on problems and get marks to gauge their leve of understanding.

On the other hand, there are some of us who would like hands on teaching with a
mentor alongside to guide us along the way. 

StudiMY puts emphasis on classroom experience and understanding when
writing its curriculum. We do not try to cram every topic to mark as many
checkboxes as possible.

checkboxes as possible.

The overall concept it to produce a higher level of understanding from practical
knowledge by doing actual exercises while walking through a particular curriculum,
with the mentor pointing in the right direction and students helping each other.

We believe this will allow students to not just be programmers, but engineers
and makers in the long run by cultivating the ability to identify reusable
concepts and self-study through trial-and-error.

Project structure
=================
Each repository in the `StudiMY project <https://github.com/StudiMY>`_ represents one classroom curriculum. Each
classroom curriculum can be considered as a 5 or 6-hour learning experience, led by at
least one mentor.
