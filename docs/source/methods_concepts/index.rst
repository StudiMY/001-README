How
===============================
There are many options to study programming using Python. Some of us learn it by
doing it ourselves through tips and tutorials we find on the internet. Some of
us learn it via books on our own pace, while others join paid classes online and
work on problems and get marks to gauge their leve of understanding.

On the other hand, there are some of us who would like hands on teaching with a
mentor alongside to guide us along the way. 

StudiMY puts emphasis on classroom experience and understanding when
writing its curriculum. We do not try to cram every topic to mark as many
checkboxes as possible.

Teaching concepts
===============================
StudiMY puts emphasis on classroom experience and understanding when
writing its curriculum. We do not try to cram every topic to mark as many
checkboxes as possible.

The overall concept it to produce a higher level of understanding from practical
knowledge by doing actual exercises while walking through a particular curriculum,
with the mentor pointing in the right direction and students helping each other.

We believe this will allow students to not just be programmers, but engineers
and makers in the long run by cultivating the ability to identify reusable
concepts and self-study through trial-and-error.

Project structure
===============================
Each repository in the `StudiMY project <https://github.com/StudiMY>`_ represents one classroom curriculum. Each
classroom curriculum can be considered as a 5 or 6-hour learning experience, led by at
least one mentor.

Licensing concept: Free to use
===============================
The curriculum and materials produced by the StudiMY project are open sourced
under the `Creative Commons Ver 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ 
license.

You are free to use the materials released under this project provided that you agree to
adhere to the terms of the license.

You are also more than welcome to be a contributor to the project, and adding
your own curriculum on Python or fix what is already here.

This is another very important concept of StudiMY. By opening up our teaching
materials and methods, we hope that more educators will find it useful to be
used as teaching materials for students of the Python language. With more
educators teaching, we hope more students will find Python a useful programming
skill and directly contributing to the number of people that can participate in
the Python community!

Of course, you are also welcomed to dowload and build the materials and practice
them on your own.
