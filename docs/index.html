<h3>What<a class="headerlink" href="#what" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>StudiMY is an initiative by MARIMORE ENGINEERING SDN. BHD. (925539-H) with
help from <a class="reference external" href="https://info.xoxzo.com/en/">Xoxzo Inc</a> to create
and maintain a study curriculum and materials for the teaching of programming in a classrom
environment, guided by a mentor.</p>
<p>StudiMY materials focuses on the Python language and includes other software, libraries or
frameworks which are Python based.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why">
<h3>Why<a class="headerlink" href="#why" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In March 2014, when the
<a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/pycon.my/pycon-malaysia/mini-pycon-my-2014">first mini PyCon (Python Conference)</a>
was held in Malaysia, we had around 70 people come to have fun and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Three years later in August 2017, when <a class="reference external" href="https://pycon.my/pycon-apac-2017-program-schedule/">PyCon APAC was held in Kuala
Lumpur</a> around 180 people
came, with nearly half of those coming from overseas, including Singapore. This
meant that the local Malaysian community as far as the conference was concerned did not
grow much since we started mini PyCon.</p>
<p>The percentage of new comers to the programming language that makes up the
attendees at these conference did not change much. We have been wondering on
why there is little uptake from the general public to get involved in Python.</p>
<p>At the same time one of the most requested item during each conference was a
tutorial about programming basics in Python.</p>
<p>Now, with the understanding that the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/09/06/professor-writes-everyone-should-code-movement-re-coding">new literacy for the future is programming</a>, the popularity and interest in Python as a first step to learning programming has
increased.</p>
<p>Coupled this with the data that we collected from the public via our <a class="reference external" href="https://studi.my/#enroll">mailing
list</a> who are interested to learn Python, we now
know that a huge interest is because the perceived need to prepare for new jobs,
we know understand that there is a huge push factor to learn programming.</p>
<p>In hindsight, those requests for Python tutorials during the PyCons makes sense.</p>
<p>I know feel that although there are many reasons for the small uptake of interest
in the general public to our PyCon conferences, one of major hurdles might and may
still be the accesibility of getting your first step to understanding and using the
programming language.</p>

<div class="section" id="how">
<h3>How<a class="headerlink" href="#how" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are many options to study programming using Python. Some of us learn it by
doing it ourselves through tips and tutorials we find on the internet. Some of
us learn it via books on our own pace, while others join paid classes online and
work on problems and get marks to gauge their leve of understanding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some of us who would like hands on teaching with a
mentor alongside to guide us along the way.</p>
<p>StudiMY puts emphasis on classroom experience and understanding when
writing its curriculum. We do not try to cram every topic to mark as many
checkboxes as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-aim">
<h2>Our Aim<a class="headerlink" href="#our-aim" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Our aim is not to be your run-of-the-mill one stop shop to study programming.
We are community driven (anyone can choose to use or contribute to the curriculum and
materials in this project) and we focus on Python as a tool for you to learn
programming.</p>
<p>Our aim is to help students and ex-students to not only learn how to use Python,
but to first transform them into engineers, capable of problem solving through understanding of the
Python ecosystem and engineering best practices, who are aware of the important role of
community to learning, and finally hopefully turn into a contributing part of that community
and help others learn to program.</p>
<p>Of course, learning programming will certainly give you a skill set to move up your carrier
or to perhaps future-proof yourself, but we do not envision the students taking
our classes to just stop there.</p>
<div class="section" id="teaching-concepts">
<h3>Teaching concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>StudiMY puts emphasis on classroom experience and understanding when
writing its curriculum. We do not try to cram every topic to mark as many
checkboxes as possible.</p>
<p>The overall concept it to produce a higher level of understanding from practical
knowledge by doing actual exercises while walking through a particular curriculum,
with the mentor pointing in the right direction and students helping each other.</p>
<p>We believe this will allow students to not just be programmers, but engineers
and makers in the long run by cultivating the ability to identify reusable
concepts and self-study through trial-and-error.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-structure">
<h3>Project structure<a class="headerlink" href="#project-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each repository in the project represents one classroom curriculum. Each
classroom curriculum can be considered as a 5 or 6-hour learning experience, led by at
least one mentor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="roadmap">
<h2>Roadmap<a class="headerlink" href="#roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A lot of Python beginners are unable to see where they are going when they learn the language in a topical manner.</p>
<p>So we came up with a mindmap, hopefully this will help us to see the bigger picture.
We have categorise the topics into roughly 6 categories:-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Syntax and Semantics</li>
<li>Data Structure</li>
<li>Algorithm</li>
<li>Programming Paradigms</li>
<li>Environment and Packaging</li>
<li>Larger Programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to list down the major pillars that will help us to be a better problem solver / software engineer and its respective topics that will help us to master them.
Although your learning is topical, knowing how to apply your knowledge is always better than just knowing the theory.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Remember !</p>
<p>It does not matter how much you know, it’s all about knowing how to apply what you know - problem solving.</p>
